# Dead by Daylight 3.0.0-dev Server

## What is this?

This server can be used in order to launch and play the 3.0.0 developer build of Dead by Daylight.

## Why?

Because alternative fixes use Behaviour's servers and may not work forever. Additionally, by using this server and setting it up properly, no data is sent to Behaviour's servers.

## How to run

1. Make sure [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14 and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed on the machine you wish to run the server on. Other versions of Node may function, but they have not been tested.
1. [Download](https://github.com/Preston159/dbd-server/releases) and extract the newest release.
1. Run `setup.bat` (or `setup.sh` on Linux) to install all necessary dependencies.
1. Run `run.bat` (or `run.sh` on Linux) to start the server.

## How to use

1. Add the following lines to the end of DefaultEngine.ini (located in DeadByDaylight/Config). Note: depending on where you downloaded the dev build from, this step may already be done.
    ```
    [/Script/Engine.NetworkSettings]
    n.VerifyPeer=false
    ```
1. Add the following entries to your HOSTS file, replacing `127.0.0.1` with the IP of the server if it isn't your local machine. Do not replace the IP in the third line, which is meant to sinkhole to 0.0.0.0 regardless of the location of the server. If you're not sure how to edit your HOSTS file, check [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/).
    ```
    127.0.0.1   latest.dev.dbd.bhvronline.com
    127.0.0.1   cdn.dev.dbd.bhvronline.com
    0.0.0.0     analytic.live.dbd.bhvronline.com
    ```
1. Launch the game using DeadByDaylight.bat.
